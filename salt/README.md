- I havent included npm -g i create-react-app. I think its better to use command npx create-react-app my-app which comes with npm 5.2+. This way you dont need to worry of keeping your create-reac  t-app up to date. You always get the newest realease.


- BUGS:
  With lenovo thinkcentre mysql won't install
